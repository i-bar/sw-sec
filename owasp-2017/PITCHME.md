## Top 10

Source: **11 large datasets** from firms that specialize in application security: 8 consulting companies and 3 product vendors.  
This data spans **hundreds of organizations** and over **50,000 real-world applications and APIs**.

The top **10** items are selected and prioritized according to
* this prevalence data +
* consensus estimates on exploitability, detectability and impact.

All data is [publicly available](https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/datacall/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202017%20Data%20Call-Public%20Release.xlsx?raw=true)!!!
